# ProjectEuler in Python

A small repo for storing my solutions to [**Project Euler**](https://projecteuler.net/) problems written in Python. I have previously solved some of the problems whilst I was at university using Java, however now I am going back over some of the programs and rewriting them in Python. 

The problems are not programming tasks *per se* as they rely heavily on mathematics for an elegant solution, but some can be brute-forced using basic maths and a programming language.
